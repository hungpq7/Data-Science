    "When we use single model, there are 2 problems can cause: high bias or high variance or both - this called weak learner. To prevent bias-variance trade-off, we can combine multiple machine learning models for regression and classification to improve prediction. This is referred to generally as **ensemble learning**\n",
    "- Variance: Variance is an error caused by sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data. This would result in the model learning noise from the training data (over-fitting)\n",
    "- Bias: This causes the model to miss the relationship between the features and target output in the training data (under-fitting)\n",
    "- Bias-variance trade-off: A good machine learning algorithm is theoretically expected to achieve low-bias and low-variance while learning the training data. However, achieving both is impossible and this is called the bias-variance trade-off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different combining techniques are chosen depending on what type of error we are trying to reduce (bias or variance)."

Observations in the dataset which were badly handled by the previous models will be weighted and fitting by next model. Intuitively, each new model focus its efforts on the most difficult observations to fit up to now, so at the end of the process, we have a strong learner with lower bias. "

    "AdaBoost is a specific boosting algorithm developed for binary classification. Adaboost usually come with decision tree has 1 node 2 leaves (called `stump`). Main idea of Adaboost are:\n",
    "- Combines several of stumps to make a strong learner\n",
    "- Stumps can be weighted so some stumps are important than others\n",
    "- Each stumps is made by taking mistake from previous stump, so the order of each stump in adaboost is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The workflow** \\\n",
    "Assume that we have $n$ samples (each sample has $a$ feature and has the same `sample weight` equal to $1/n$ - Total of sample weight is 1). To find the order of stump, we made stumps with each feature, calculate the gini index for each stump then the stump has the smallest gini will be the first.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we determine the weight of stump based on how well it classified the samples - or we call `Amount of say`. The total error of stump is `the sum of the weight assigned to the incorrect classified samples` (eg: if we have 2 incorrect samples then this stump will has $2/n$ total error). The formular of amount of say:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mbox{Amount of say} = L*ln(\\frac{1-\\mbox{total error}}{\\mbox{total error}})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With $L$ is learning rate and this equation mean the less total error the larger amount of say.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third idea of adaboost is the next stump is made by taking mistake from previous stump. For the next stump to relize the incorrect sample from first stump, we need to increase the sample weight of incorrect sample and decrease the others. Formular of new sample weight:\n",
    "- For incorrect sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mbox{new sample weight} = \\mbox{sample weight} * e^{\\mbox{amount of say}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- For others:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mbox{new sample weight} = \\mbox{sample weight} * e^{-\\mbox{amount of say}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we normalize all new sample weight to add up to 1. Using the new sample weigth for the next stump until we get all stump done.\n",
    "Lastly, to made prediction with adaboost, we have 2 group of stumps: classify on A or classify on B. If sum of amout of say of group A is bigger, the observation will be in class A and and vice versa."

    "The first step of fitting XGboost to the training data is making the initial prediction $p_0$ (default is `0.5` for both regression and classification). Like GBM, XGboost fit a tree to the residual of each observation but each tree in XGboost is unique. XGB build a tree which try to minimize the equation:\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^{n}L(y_i,p_{i}^0+O_{value}) + \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda*{O^2_{value}}  \\space \\mbox{(1)}$$\n",
    "with $L$ is *loss function* and ($\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda*{O^2_{value}}$) is *regularization term*.\\\n",
    "The goal of XGB is finding the optimal output value to minimize the equation $(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make an Xgboost tree, firstly we calculate the residuals of each obs different to initial prediction then making similariry score for the root:\n",
    "$$\\mbox{Similariry Score} = \\frac{(\\sum gradient)^2}{\\sum hessian + \\lambda}$$\n",
    "Similarity score tell us the similarity between residual of observations, if residuals is different, they cancel out the others so that the similarity score will be small. And $\\lambda$ is the regularization parameter, it's intend to reduce the prediction's sensitivity to individual observations and then prevent overfitting. When $\\lambda$ increase, the similarity score wil be decrease - the amount of decrease is inversely proportional to the number of residual in the node.\\\n",
    "After having the similarity for the root, we find an optimal split point for the tree. We'll choose one threshold to split the obs and then calculating similarity score for each node. To quantify how much better the leaves similar residual than the root, we calculate the gain:\n",
    "$$\\mbox{gain} = \\mbox{left}_{similarity} + \\mbox{right}_{similarity} - \\mbox{root}_{similarity}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compare the gain of this thresold to the others and the threshold which made the largest gain will be chosen. Continue building tree with other feature until getting the maximum split.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have the full tree, to prune the tree, we use $\\gamma$ parameter. If $gain - \\gamma < 0$, we prune that leave.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step is find the output for each leaf of the tree. To do that, we derivate the equation $(1)$ and we get the formular for optimal output:\n",

    "## 2.4. LightGBM\n",
    "\n",
    "LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework which use tree based learning algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why lightgbm became powerful are:\n",
    "1. Optimization in accuracy: \n",
    "- LigthGBM uses *leaf_wise* stategy to grow the tree vertically. It will choose the leaf with max delta  loss to grow. \n",
    "- Optimal split for category feature. Other boosting can only use one-hot encoding for category feature but lightGBM can treat feature values equally although values in numeric (i.e: gender 0-unknow, 1-man, 2-woman)\n",
    "2.  Optimization in speed and memory usage: \n",
    "- LightGBM uses histogram-based algorithms, which bucket continuous feature values into discrete bins. Algo will find the best split between bins.\n",
    "- LightGBM uses Gradient-based one side sampling (GOSS) method. By usual, subsample process is done by taking random sample from dataset. But GOSS not only perform a faster way to do this but also keep distribution of the data. The instances with larger gradients (under-trained), contribute a lot more to the tree building process so we keep all instances with large gradient, but to prevent changing the distribution, we need to perform random sampling on instances with small gradients. Assume we have \n",
    "$n$ data instances, if we keep $a$ instances with large gradients and randomly samples $x$% $(n-a)$ instances with small gradients, we have the sampled data with size $a+ x$% $*(n-a)$. \n",
    "3. Sparse Optimization:\n",
    "- LightGBM handle sparse data by using Exclusive feature bundling (EFB). EFB is a technique that uses a greedy algorithm to combine (or bundle) these mutually exclusive (means never take non-zero in the same time) into a single feature and thus reduce the dimensionality.\n",
    "4. Optimization in Distributed Learning:\n",
    "- Distributed learning allows the use of multiple machines to produce a single model.\n",
    "- Feature parallel: Data had split vertically, each worker handle a subset of feature to find the best split on local feature set then they communicate to others to get the best one. \n",
    "- Data parallel: Data had split horizontally, each worker will construct the local histograms then merge them to make global histogram of the data and find the best split on global histogram. \n",
    "- Voting parallel: It is the special case of data parallel when communication cost is constant.\n",
